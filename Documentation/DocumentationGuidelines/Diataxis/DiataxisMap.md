# Diataxis

Diataxis will be the implemented documetation framework and philosophie for this project. For consistency reasons a specific documentational framework was set prior to conducting the documentaiton of this project that will be followed.

To make documentational wording specific and definitions unique and simplify documentation for the reaearcher.

## Reference Picture

As you can see from the map:

    tutorials and how-to guides are concerned with what the user does (action)

    reference and explanation are about what the user knows (cognition)

On the other hand:

    tutorials and explanation serve the acquistion of skill (the user’s study)

    how-to guides and reference serve the application of skill (the user’s work)

But a map doesn’t tell you what to do - it’s reference. To guide your action you need a different sort of tool, in this case, a kind of Diátaxis compass.
