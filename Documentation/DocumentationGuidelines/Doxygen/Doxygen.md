# ðŸ“— Introduction to Doxygen

**Doxygen** is a widely-used tool for generating documentation from annotated C, C++, and other programming language source files. It extracts specially formatted comments from the code and produces comprehensive documentation in formats like HTML, LaTeX, and PDF.

Doxygen is especially effective for large or complex codebases where maintaining separate documentation would be inefficient. It supports class hierarchies, call graphs, file structure, and integrates well with projects written in C or C++ â€” making it ideal for embedded systems and robotics.

## âœ… Key Features

- Extracts documentation directly from source code comments.
- Supports diagrams like class hierarchies and call graphs (via Graphviz).
- Generates cross-referenced documentation for functions, classes, and files.
- Integrates with tools like **Breathe** to connect with Sphinx for unified docs.
- Supports multiple programming languages including C, C++, Python, Java.

Doxygen helps keep your documentation in sync with your code and improves readability, maintainability, and onboarding.
