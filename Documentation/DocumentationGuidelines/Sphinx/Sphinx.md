# ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Sphinx

**Sphinx** is a powerful documentation generator that is widely used in the Python and open-source community. Originally developed for the Python documentation itself, Sphinx converts reStructuredText (`.rst`) or Markdown (`.md`) files into beautifully formatted HTML, PDF, and other formats.

Sphinx is particularly well-suited for projects that use Python, but it can also integrate with C/C++ documentation generated by tools like **Doxygen**, using the **Breathe** extension. This makes it ideal for multi-language projects such as autonomous robotic systems.

## âœ… Key Features

- Automatic API documentation from Python docstrings using `autodoc`.
- Clean, navigable output in HTML, LaTeX (PDF), ePub, and more.
- Integration with versioning and hosting platforms like **Read the Docs**.
- Support for extensions like `breathe`, `napoleon`, and `autosectionlabel`.
- Easy cross-referencing between code, modules, and guides.

Sphinx helps you create professional, maintainable documentation that scales with your project.
