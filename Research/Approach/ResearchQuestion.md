# Problem Definition
In precision agriculture, autonomous robots are increasingly being deployed for tasks like monitoring, weeding, and harvesting in arable vegetable fields. For effective navigation and mapping, these robots require robust localization and mapping capabilities. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in providing real-time, accurate maps while enabling the robot to understand its location within the environment. However, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of arable fields, with changing crops, environmental conditions, and terrain, presents unique challenges for implementing SLAM solutions. The problem lies in determining how to adapt and optimize SLAM algorithms for these real-world agricultural environments, ensuring efficient and reliable performance under diverse conditions.
