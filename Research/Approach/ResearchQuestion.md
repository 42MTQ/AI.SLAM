# Problem Definition

The unique challenges presented by dynamic and heterogeneous arable fields, such as variable crops, changing terrain, and fluctuating environmental conditions, require SLAM solutions to be adaptive and optimized. This research seeks to explore how SLAM algorithms can be customized to enable agricultural robots to efficiently map and localize in these complex environments, ensuring reliable performance across various conditions.
