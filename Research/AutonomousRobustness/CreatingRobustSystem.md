# Designing Robust Autonmous Systems

Based on autonomous aviation example. Created to further strengthen thouroughness.

1. Simulate Both Normal and Edge Cases

    “It must be subjected to a variety of nominal and off-nominal conditions...”

    Application: Test your SLAM algorithm not only in ideal (clean, GPS-available, open field) conditions, but also in edge cases:

        Poor GPS reception

        Occluded camera views (e.g., plant canopies, dirt on lenses)

        Sensor noise, lag, or failure

        Field irregularities (e.g., puddles, uneven terrain)

2. Assessment Beyond Pass/Fail

    “There may be several gradations of ‘desired’ results... scoring is never binary.”

    Application: Develop a multi-metric evaluation system:

        Accuracy of localization (e.g., RMSE of trajectory)

        Map completeness and consistency

        Time to converge on a stable map

        Robustness to disturbances (e.g., false loop closures)

        Comparison against a human-controlled baseline (e.g., RTK-GPS ground truth)

3. Knowledge Check Equivalents

    “Perform a check of MAG and TRUE heading displays... GPS vs. origin waypoints...”

    Application: Translate these into SLAM-relevant checks for your robot:

        Is the IMU correctly fused with visual odometry?

        Is loop closure correctly triggering?

        Is the robot detecting sensor drift or inconsistency?

        Is the localization consistent with GPS or known landmarks?

4. Use of Simulation and Modeling

    “Simulation and modeling are key approaches to assessing the capabilities...”

    Application:

        Use Gazebo, Isaac Sim, or other 3D simulators to model environments before deploying in real fields.

        Include variability: different weather, light, plant height, partial occlusion, etc.

5. Factor in Situational Awareness & Trust

    “What level of SA does the pilot/IA have of the system’s state?”

    Application: Your robot should:

        Be aware of localization confidence (covariance, entropy, etc.)

        Have fallback procedures (e.g., switch to GPS if SLAM fails)

        Be able to log and display diagnostics for human operators (trust and interpretability)

6. Evaluate IA Learning vs. Human Intuition

    “Compare simulator performance assessments of human operators to IA...”

    Application:

        Compare robot behavior in similar tasks to manual driving or GPS-logged ground truth.

        Let a human operator define a "best case" route and compare with SLAM-generated pathing.

7. Build Tests for Task Competency

    “Demonstration Task 3: Perform a check for problems with sensors...”

    Application: Design specific competency tests for your robot:

        Can it re-localize after a blackout?

        Can it detect SLAM failure and notify the operator?

        Does it initialize correctly at system startup?

        Are calibration and frame transforms correct?

8. Vary Contextual Conditions in Testing

    “Simulation should define and proffer variants of... operational and physical environment”

    Application: During testing, vary:

        Lighting (day, dusk, shadows from crops)

        Plant growth stage (early vs mature crops)

        Presence of weeds, holes, or unexpected terrain
