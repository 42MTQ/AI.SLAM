# Abilities of Industrial Autonomous Systems

The intent of using autonomous systems is mainly (a) to
tame the complexity of a system of systems by using au-
tonomous components [42], (b) to make the system robust
concerning fundamental uncertainties [12], (c) to reduce
the workload of human operators [43] or (d) to operate in
hostile environments [36] where teleoperation is not feasi-

tonomous systems.
ble. As the intent of using autonomy and the understand-
ing of autonomy vary (cf. Section 3), the abilities ascribed
to industrial autonomous systems vary as well. Neverthe-
less, the abilities may be linked to the found characteris-
tics and may be structured. The approach of structuring
the characteristics and abilities is visualized in Fig. 2.
The industrial autonomous system is divided into the
characteristics (rectangles) systematic process execution,
adaptability, self-governance, self-containedness and the
corresponding abilities (rounded rectangles) as denoted in
Fig. 2. The precise definitions of the abilities and the refer-
ences to the literature are listed in Table 3.
Referring to the Cambridge Dictionary, an ability is
“the mental or physical power or skill needed to do
something”. Transferring this definition to industrial au-
tonomous systems, an ability describes the power or skill
of the system to do something.
The abilities are structured into two layers where the
sub-abilities contribute to the main abilities. In some cases
sub-abilities contribute to several main abilities, e. g.,
reactivity contributes to both, goal-orientation and self-
directedness. The abilities that are necessary to give the
system the essential characteristics of an autonomous sys-
tem differ from case to case.
