# Fault Tree Analysis

Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a top-down, deductive failure analysis method used to determine the root causes of system failures. It visually represents how combinations of component failures, human errors, and external events can lead to a defined undesirable event (called the Top Event).
ðŸ”§ Key Concepts of FTA:

    Top Event: The system-level failure you're analyzing (e.g., "robot stops responding").

    Intermediate Events: Failures that result from other lower-level faults.

    Basic Events: The root causes (e.g., sensor failure, software bug).

    Logic Gates: AND, OR, etc., connect events and model how faults combine.

ðŸ¤– Application in Robotics:

In robotics, especially for control logic and safety, FTA helps identify weaknesses in:

1. Sensor Dependencies

    Top Event: "Robot navigates off course"

    Basic Events: LIDAR failure, GPS signal loss, IMU error

    Use FTA to ensure redundancy and error-checking logic in software.

2. Actuator and Motion Control

    Top Event: "Robot arm crashes into object"

    Basic Events: Motor driver failure, encoder feedback error, controller timing bug

3. Autonomous Control Logic

    Top Event: "Autonomous decision failure"

    Intermediate Events: Faulty input data â†’ incorrect path planning â†’ unsafe action

    FTA identifies where software fails to handle edge cases or faults.

4. Communication and Power

    Top Event: "Robot stops moving"

    Basic Events: ROS node crash, power loss to motor controller, WiFi disconnect

âœ… Benefits for Robotic Systems:

    Highlights single points of failure

    Encourages redundancy and fail-safes

    Helps design E-stop mechanisms or fallback behaviors

    Can be paired with FMEA or HAZOP for broader system safety
