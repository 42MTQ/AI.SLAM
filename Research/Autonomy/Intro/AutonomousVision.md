# The Vision for Autonomy

## The vision

The future state envisions an “autonomous agent” no longer restricted by the inability to be certified as trustworthy at an
acceptable level of operation and risk. Acknowledging that the “autonomous agent” can take many forms, e.g. as a
rational decision maker for manned / unmanned aircraft, cyber systems, satellites, or weapons, the vision depicts a future
where alternate evidence of verification and validation can be generated through additional techniques in addition to
current M&S and T&E methods. The results from these methods can be recorded in a modular fashion, enabling
compositional verification of autonomous subcomponents at appropriate levels of abstraction, thereby reducing the
system-level V&V challenge. Additionally, similar to case law, well-defined and iteratively developed autonomous agents
will be able to establish a precedent through past performance and use of “training” as a method of certification. Finally,
development of autonomous agents will be iterative, continuous, and evolutionary, reducing the software development
cycle burden.
