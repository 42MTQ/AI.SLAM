# Training Environment for Autonomous Applications

Approaches for autonomous operations and control can be divided
into several categories: model-based approaches, adaptive approaches,
distributed approaches, and fault-tolerant approaches. These categories
are not mutually disjoint.

Model-based approaches are based on the use of a model of a
part or the entire technical system to conclude specific interventions
and control actions. The models can be used in various use cases in
operations, as the following approaches illustrate. Zenith et al. (2010)
investigate autonomy of direct methanol fuel-cell systems by model-
based analysis of the variables in operating conditions influencing
water balance issues. Especially in combination with predictive con-
cepts (e.g., Model-Predictive Control (MPC)), these approaches have been
widely recognized and used in scientific and industrial use cases.
