# Fuzzy Logic

The term fuzzy refers to things that are not clear or are vague. In the real world many times we encounter a situation when we canâ€™t determine whether the state is true or false, their fuzzy logic provides very valuable flexibility for reasoning. In this way, we can consider the inaccuracies and uncertainties of any situation. 

Fuzzy Logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1, instead of just the traditional values of true or false. It is used to deal with imprecise or uncertain information and is a mathematical method for representing vagueness and uncertainty in decision-making.

Fuzzy Logic is based on the idea that in many cases, the concept of true or false is too restrictive, and that there are many shades of gray in between. It allows for partial truths, where a statement can be partially true or false, rather than fully true or false.

Fuzzy Logic is used in a wide range of applications, such as control systems, image processing, natural language processing, medical diagnosis, and artificial intelligence

## Summary

In summary, Fuzzy Logic is a mathematical method for representing vagueness and uncertainty in decision-making, it allows for partial truths, and it is used in a wide range of applications. It is based on the concept of membership function and the implementation is done using Fuzzy rules.

In the boolean system truth value, 1.0 represents the absolute truth value and 0.0 represents the absolute false value. But in the fuzzy system, there is no logic for the absolute truth and absolute false value. But in fuzzy logic, there is an intermediate value too present which is partially true and partially false.

### Use Case

Fuzzy logic has also been used for multi-object optimization problems. Lakhdari and
Sculfort [8] define a hierarchical model for optimizing a manufacturing system based on
subjective and objective attributes. Their overall goal is to measure the effectiveness of a
system in terms of lead time, quality, and cost. These attributes are broken into the sub-
attributes that contribute to them. For example, lead time is considered to be dependent
on human resources, material resources, and flexibility. These second-tier attributes are
further dependent on basic, measurable items such as machine reliability, availability of
raw materials, scrap rates, etc. By combining the basic measures through a structured
hierarchy, different scenarios for manufacturing can be compared.

### Logic Control with Fuzzy Algorithmic

A control system is an arrangement of physical components designed to alter another physical system so that this system exhibits certain desired characteristics. There exist two types of control systems: open-loop and closed-loop control systems. In open-loop control systems, the input control action is independent of the physical system output. On the other hand, in a closed-loop control system, the input control action depends on the physical system output. Closed-Hoop control systems are also known as feedback control systems. The first step toward controlling any physical variable is to measure it. A sensor measures the controlled signal, A plant is a physical system under control. In a closed-loop control system, forcing signals of the system inputs are determined by the output responses of the system.
