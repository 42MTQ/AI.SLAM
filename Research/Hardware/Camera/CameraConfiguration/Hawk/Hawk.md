Introduction
The Hawk camera, engineered to emulate human visual perception, harnesses the power of its twin 'eyes' and triangulation techniques. This advanced approach enables the Hawk camera to generate a detailed three-dimensional insight into the viewed scene. This capability not only facilitates spatial awareness and motion detection for your applications but also enhances interactive experiences, making it ideal for applications in fields like AR(augmented reality), robotics, and advanced surveillance systems.
