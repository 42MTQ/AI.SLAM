# Body Tracking 

## Overview

This section contains the following code samples:

    Body Tracking: This sample shows how to use the Body Tracking module, using a single camera and a simple 3D display.

    Tracking Data Export: This sample shows how to export human body tracking data into a JSON format. You can adapt the code to fit your needs.

    Integrations This folder contains links to other repositories that provide Body Tracking integration examples and tutorials with Unreal Engine 5, Unity, and Livelink.

    Multi Camera Fusion: This sample demonstrates how to use the ZED SDK Fusion API to track people in an entire space, with data from multiple cameras which produces higher quality results than using a single camera. The sample goes through the full process of setting up your cameras, calibrating your system with ZED360, fusing and visualizing the data.
