# Camera Streaming

## Overview

This repository contains the following code samples:

    ZED Stream Sender: This sample demonstrates how to use the ZED SDK to establish a network connection, encode a live video stream, and transmit it to a remote client. The ZED SDK handles all aspects of network communication, video encoding, and transmission, making it easy to integrate the ZED camera into applications that require remote video capture and processing, such as computer vision, remote monitoring, or teleoperation.

    ZED Stream Receiver: This sample demonstrates how to use the ZED SDK to receive and decode video data sent from a remote ZED stream.
