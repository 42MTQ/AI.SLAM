# Depth Sensing

## Overview

This section contains the following code samples:

    Depth Sensing sample: This sample demonstrates how to extract depth information from a single ZED camera and visualize it in an OpenGL window.
    Depth Sensing with multiple cameras: This sample provides an example of how to design an app that use multiple ZED cameras in separated threads and displays RGB and depth maps in OpenCV.
    Region Of Interest This sample showcases how to define a Region of Interest (ROI), pixels outside of this area are discard from the all modules (depth, positional tracking, detections ...).
    Image Refocus This sample illustrates how to apply depth-dependent blur to an image, allowing users to adjust the focal point after the image has been taken.
    Export Shows how to save both image and depth map as png files to be later ingest as input in other application.
