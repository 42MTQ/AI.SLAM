# Object Detection 

## Overview

This section contains the following code samples:

    Birds Eye Viewer Detected objects are presented in a top-down view alongside the 3D point cloud, providing an intuitive perspective on object placement.

    Concurrent Detections: This sample demonstrates how to simultaneously run Object detection and Body Tracking modules, which allow to use of both detectors in a single application.

    Image Viewer: Detected objects are displayed in a 2D view making it simple to identify and track objects of interest.

    Custom Detector: This sample shows how to use a custom object detector on ZED images. The ZED SDK then computes 3D information and performs object tracking on detected objects.
