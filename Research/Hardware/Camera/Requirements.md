# Requirements

âœ… 1. Identify the Camera Interface Type

Make sure the camera uses one of these standard interfaces supported by Orin and ROS:

    USB (e.g. USB 3.0/2.0)

    CSI (for embedded cameras like Raspberry Pi Camera or official NVIDIA camera modules)

    Ethernet (for industrial GigE Vision cameras)

    MIPI (common in mobile cameras; usually needs specific drivers)

âœ… 2. Check Driver Compatibility

Check if there is a ROS driver or GStreamer/V4L2 support for your camera:
ðŸ”¹ USB/CSI Cameras (e.g. RealSense, ZED, Orbbec, etc.)

    âœ… Intel RealSense â†’ Use realsense2_camera

    âœ… ZED/ZED2 â†’ Use zed-ros2-wrapper

    âœ… Generic USB cameras â†’ Use usb_cam or v4l2_camera packages

    âœ… MIPI/CSI Cameras on Orin â†’ Use NVIDIA's Jetson Multimedia API or GStreamer and publish to ROS

ðŸ”¹ Isaac ROS Compatible Cameras:

Isaac ROS supports sensors that work with:

    image_transport

    GStreamer pipelines

    sensor_msgs/Image

    Tip: Check the Isaac ROS Camera Sample to see compatible formats and expectations.
