# Choosing an MCU for IMU Sensor Fusion

## ✅ Key Requirements for Sensor Fusion

1. 32-bit MCU with FPU

    You need a Cortex-M4, M7, or ESP32-class processor.

    Must have an FPU (Floating Point Unit) to handle math in quaternions, Euler angles, matrices, etc.

2. High RAM (≥64KB)

    Fusion algorithms like Madgwick, Mahony, or Kalman filters eat up RAM.

    You need space for sensor data buffers, fusion outputs, and possible BLE/WiFi if needed.

3. I2C/SPI Support

    Sensor should be able to stream data fast — preferably SPI at 1+ MHz for low-latency.

4. Real-time Processing

    Timers, fast interrupt response, low jitter, optional DMA (for sampling precision).

## Design

    Sensor Fusion MCU (like Teensy/ESP32):

        Reads raw 9DoF data (accel, gyro, mag)

        Runs Madgwick, Mahony, or Kalman algorithm

        Outputs:

            Quaternion or Euler orientation

            Tilt-compensated accelerations

            Possibly gravity vector or heading

        Sends processed data to the main processor

    Main Controller (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson, Orin, STM32 master):

        Uses the fused orientation for:

            Balancing

            Path planning

            SLAM

            Dead-reckoning

            Motion control

## Implementation

    Run fusion at >100 Hz if possible (especially for fast movements)

    Use interrupt-based IMU reading or a timer

    Output quaternions if possible → no gimbal lock

    Format data cleanly for downstream systems (e.g., JSON, CSV, or binary struct)

    Add a timestamp to sync with other sensors
