# Multimedia

NVIDIA® Jetson™ Linux includes the below multimedia features.

The nvbuf_utils to NvUtils Migration Guide can be found on https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-linux-r351.

It provides information that is helpful for converting existing applications from nvbuf_utils, an API for multimedia buffer management and transformations, to NvUtils, a new API for the same purpose. Starting with Jetson Linux release 34, NvUtils is introduced and nvbuf_utils is deprecated.
