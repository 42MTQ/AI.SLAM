## Description

What is NVIDIA DeepStream?

NVIDIA’s DeepStream SDK is a complete streaming analytics toolkit based on GStreamer for AI-based multi-sensor processing, video, audio, and image understanding. It’s ideal for vision AI developers, software partners, startups, and OEMs building IVA apps and services.

You can now create stream-processing pipelines that incorporate neural networks and other complex processing tasks like tracking, video encoding/decoding, and video rendering. These pipelines enable real-time analytics on video, image, and sensor data.
