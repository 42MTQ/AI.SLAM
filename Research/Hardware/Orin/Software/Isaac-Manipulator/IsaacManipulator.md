# Isaac Manipulator

NVIDIA Isaac™ Manipulator, built on Isaac ROS, is a collection of NVIDIA® CUDA®-accelerated libraries, AI models, and reference workflows. It’s designed to help robotics software developers build AI-enabled robot arms—or manipulators—that can perceive, understand, and interact with their environments. This gives you a powerful tool for accelerating solutions for dynamic challenges such as machine tending, bin picking, inspection, and assembly tasks.

You can integrate any of the Isaac Manipulator libraries or foundation models into your software stacks, bringing accelerated performance and accuracy to your own platforms.

## How NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator Works

Isaac Manipulator is comprised of NVIDIA-accelerated libraries, AI models, and reference workflows for robot developers. The software uses NVIDIA cuMotion, a motion planner running multiple trajectory optimizations simultaneously to return the best solution. Isaac Manipulator also uses state-of-the-art foundation models for 6D pose estimation and tracking of novel objects, as well as object detection in indoor environments.
