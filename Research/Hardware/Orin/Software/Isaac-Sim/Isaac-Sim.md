# Isaac Sim

NVIDIA Isaac Sim™ is a reference application built on NVIDIA Omniverse™ that enables developers to simulate and test AI-driven robotics solutions in physically based virtual environments.

Isaac Sim is fully extensible. This enables developers to build Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based custom simulators or integrate core Isaac Sim technologies into existing testing and validation pipelines. 

Ready to get started? Download the SDK through the Omniverse Launcher, pull it as a container from NGC, or install it using a command line with pip.

## How Isaac Sim Works

Isaac Sim facilitates three essential workflows: generating synthetic data for training and fine-tuning robot foundation models, conducting software-in-the-loop testing for robot stacks, and enabling robot learning through Isaac™ Lab.
