# What is Simulation

Robots are moving goods in warehouses, packaging foods and helping assemble vehicles â€” bringing enhanced automation to use cases across industries.

There are two keys to their success: Physical AI and robotics simulation.

Physical AI describes AI models that can understand and interact with the physical world. Physical AI embodies the next wave of autonomous machines and robots, such as self-driving cars, industrial manipulators, mobile robots, humanoids and even robot-run infrastructure like factories and warehouses.

With virtual commissioning of robots in digital worlds, robots are first trained using robotic simulation software before they are deployed for real-world use cases.
Robotics Simulation Summarized

An advanced robotics simulator facilitates robot learning and testing of virtual robots without requiring the physical robot. By applying physics principles and replicating real-world conditions, these simulators generate synthetic datasets to train machine learning models for deployment on physical robots.

Simulations are used for initial AI model training and then to validate the entire software stack, minimizing the need for physical robots during testing. NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a reference application built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, provides accurate visualizations and supports Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based workflows for advanced robot simulation and validation.
