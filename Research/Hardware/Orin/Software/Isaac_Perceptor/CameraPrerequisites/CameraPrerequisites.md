# Supported Camera Configurations

The following configurations are supported in this release (Isaac 3.2). Please note that most of the camera configurations tagged as ‘Provided’ are supported out-of-the-box, meaning we offer launch files to initialize the camera. However, RGBD Stereo Cameras require the user to configure or build their own launch files. This is to ensure flexibility and to enable users to tailor configurations to their specific needs.
