# Isaac Perceptor

NVIDIA Isaac™ Perceptor, built on Isaac ROS, is a collection of NVIDIA® CUDA®-accelerated libraries, AI models, and reference workflows for the development of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). These robots are designed to perceive, localize, and operate in unstructured environments like warehouses, factories, and outdoor settings.

You can integrate one or all of Isaac Perceptor’s technologies into your own AMR software stack to achieve advanced AI for perception capabilities or evaluate it with the NVIDIA Nova Orin™ Developer Kit.
