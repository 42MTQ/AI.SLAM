##### Getting Started

The Isaac ROS suite has been developed and released by NVIDIA to leverage the power of NVIDIA acceleration on NVIDIA Jetson and discrete GPUs for standard robotics applications.

Isaac ROS uses standard ROS interfaces on input and output topics, making it extremely easy to use as a drop-in replacement for commonly-used, CPU-based ROS implementations familiar to robotics developers.
