# Power Estimation Tool for Jetson

Toolkit for managing power consumption of the Jetson family, based on concurrent programs running.
PowerEstimator is a power estimation tool for Jetson systems-on-module (SOMs). It estimates average SOM power consumption and generates an nvpmodel configuration file for the system configuration and target workload being modeled.
