### Description

RedHawk Linux is a real-time Linux operating system developed by Concurrent Real-Time, designed specifically for applications that require high-performance computing and deterministic response times, such as:

    Aerospace and defense systems

    Automotive testing

    Industrial control systems

    Simulations and data acquisition
#### Key features:

    Real-Time Performance: RedHawk is optimized for low-latency, deterministic behavior with real-time response in microseconds.

    Based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): It retains compatibility with the RHEL ecosystem while adding real-time capabilities.

    NightStar Tools: Provides advanced development and debugging tools for real-time applications.

    Multi-Core Support: Designed for systems with multiple CPUs and supports CPU affinity to dedicate cores to specific tasks.

    High Availability & Scalability: Suitable for mission-critical applications with support for clustering and failover.
#### Common Use Cases:

    Real-time simulation (e.g., flight or automotive simulators)

    Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing

    High-speed data acquisition and control

RedHawk is often chosen when standard Linux distributions cannot meet the strict timing requirements of critical systems.
