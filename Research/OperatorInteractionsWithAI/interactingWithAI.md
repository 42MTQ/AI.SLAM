Scenarios for operator interactions in autonomous systems
## Scenarios

possible Scenarios for Operator Intervention

### Scenario 1

Supervisory control, decision making and recommendation.
The autonomous system takes over monitoring tasks in which the
system is monitored, data is collected and analyzed, and based on
this, decisions are then made and forwarded to the human operators.
Human operators are then responsible for carrying out certain activities
in the plant. These activities include, in particular, tasks that cannot
be performed by an autonomous system. Final decisions are taken by
humans, but they can rely on the supporting capabilities of autonomous
systems.

#### Scenario 2

Routine vs. Exception. The autonomous system takes over
routine activities, i.e., the same steps are performed very frequently, so
that they are very well tested and defined. Human operators take over
specialized and exceptional tasks that occur especially in situations that
cannot be foreseen. Thus, control is handed over from the autonomous
system to the human operator.

### Scenario 3

Dynamic collaboration. The assignment of tasks between
autonomous systems and human operators will be dynamic based on
workload, level of difficulty, and flexibility. Here, more complex tasks
can also be handed over to the autonomous system, as these can already
partially perform human activities. However, if failures occur, etc.,
where the autonomous system fails, the human operator must step in.

### Scenario 4

Learning environment. Autonomous systems and human
operators can learn from each other. Here, the human operator can use
autonomous systems to run through scenarios that cannot be practiced
in real environments (e.g., fault scenarios). This ensures that safety
is maintained in the plant while the operator is being trained. On
the other hand, the autonomous system can learn from inputs from
operators to build a virtual operator model. Here, multiple scenarios
can also be run, and the operator’s reactions can be captured.
