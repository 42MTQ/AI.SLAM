## Overview

This section contains a summary of the research, objectives, and methodologies. It provides an introduction to the different areas of focus.

- [Research Overview](overview.md)

## SLAM vs SLAM different Approaches

This section covers research related to the variances and differences in varying SLAM implementations / approaches and design decisions.

- [Evaluating Different Approaches](approach-evaluation/evaluation-setup.md)
- [Data Analysis](approach-evaluation/approach-data.md)

## Pre - Processing Pipeline

Here, you will find detailed documentation about the design and development of a Pre - SLAM data processing pipeline.

- [SLAM preprocessing](led-module-design/design.md)
- [LPre-Processing Pipeline](pipeline-design/pipeline.md)

## The SLAM Approach

This part contains details about the custom SLAM approach that was designed and build by myself. It was designed to perfectly fit the needs of agricultural robotics and to face the challenges of its difficult environment.

- [SLAM Setup](SLAM/setup.md)
- [Mapping and Localization](SLAM/mapping-localization.md)
- [Verification and Validation](SLAM/verification-validation.md)
- [Testing and Assessing](SLAM/slam-test.md)

## SLAM-Based Mapping and Localization for Agricultural Robotics

This section focuses on the SLAM-based 3D mapping project for agricultural fields. It includes the implementation, testing, and performance evaluation of different SLAM algorithms.
