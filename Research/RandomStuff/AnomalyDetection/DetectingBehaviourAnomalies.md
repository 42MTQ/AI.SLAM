# Concept: Robot Behavior Anomaly Detection Layer

üéØ Goal:

Detect deviations in real-time robot behavior (e.g., pose estimates, velocity commands, map updates) that differ significantly from historical or expected behavior patterns ‚Äî flagging them as potential faults, anomalies, or risks.
üß† Key Design Approaches:

1. Baseline Comparison (Statistical / Rule-Based)

    Track recent history of behavior: e.g., velocity, pose delta, sensor input frequency.

    Compare with running average, threshold ranges, or statistical variance.

Example:
If robot usually moves 0.1‚Äì0.2 m/s but suddenly spikes to 1.5 m/s ‚Üí anomaly.
2. Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection

    Use historical time-series data from normal operation.

    Train models like:

        Autoencoders

        LSTM-based prediction + deviation scoring

        Isolation Forest / One-Class SVM

Features to monitor:

    Odometry drift rate

    SLAM confidence / covariance

    CPU/GPU load

    Loop closure frequency

    Number of matched keypoints

3. Contextual Awareness

    Anomalies can be normal in certain contexts (e.g., sharp turns in tight rows).

    Use environmental context (e.g., GPS, crop row type) as input to the model.

üîß How It Fits into Your Stack:

[Sensors] ‚Üí [SLAM] ‚Üí [State Estimator] ‚Üí [Control] ‚Üí [Anomaly Layer]
                                             ‚Üë
                                  [Monitor pose, velocity, error, SLAM quality]

    The layer sits after core control, listens to ROS topics like /odom, /cmd_vel, /tf, /slam/debug

    It publishes anomalies to a new topic: /anomaly_events

    Can trigger soft safety responses (pause, log, notify)

‚úÖ Use Cases:

    Detect visual aliasing (repetitive fields confuse SLAM ‚Üí unexpected motion)

    Identify when mapping fails silently (pose valid but drifting)

    Hardware degradation (e.g., slipping wheels, overheating GPU)

    Prevent robot from continuing in corrupted state

## Anomaly Detection layer

Your anomaly detection layer acts like a behavioral watchdog, and yes, it must continuously monitor real-time inputs and outputs, then compare them against an internal baseline or expected model to detect deviations.
üîÑ How It Works Conceptually:
Input Source Compare Against	What You Detect
Real-time velocity, pose, SLAM updates	Expected behavior model (statistical, learned, rule-based)	Spikes, drifts, timing anomalies
Sensor data rate or quality	Historical norms or thresholds	Degradation, dropouts
Actuator commands vs movement	Actual vs intended movement (e.g., via odometry)	Slippage, control failure
SLAM confidence/quality	Normal variance from previous runs	Map divergence, poor loop closures
üß† System Roles:

    Anomaly Monitor Node (your module):

        Subscribes to topics like /odom, /cmd_vel, /slam_status

        Stores and analyzes recent history (e.g., rolling window of 5‚Äì10 seconds)

        Flags anomalies ‚Üí publishes to /anomaly_events or logs

    Validator / Supervisor System (optional or external):

        Consumes anomaly flags and real-time data

        Decides on actions: log-only, notify, slow down, soft E-stop

        May involve humans or higher-level robot logic

üîê Real Use Example (Agricultural SLAM Robot):

    Expected: Driving forward slowly (0.2 m/s), small pose updates

    Actual: Robot outputs high velocity but pose isn‚Äôt changing ‚Üí anomaly

    Detected Cause: Wheel slip or SLAM failure

    Anomaly Layer: Flags it, raises /anomaly_event

    Supervisor Layer: Switches to fallback behavior or stops

### Real world example

has to be context aware to make scene assumptions to define "anomaly".

#### Detecting into Identification

After detecting an anomaly, it has to be identified and its respective recovery behaviour needs to be triggered.
