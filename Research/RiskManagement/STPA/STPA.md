# System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)

hazard analysis technique used to identify and mitigate potential risks in complex systems. Developed by Nancy Leveson, STPA is based on systems theory and focuses on identifying unsafe interactions between components of a system, rather than just looking at individual failures or components. It is particularly effective for safety-critical systems, including autonomous robots, aviation, automotive, and other fields where failures can lead to significant consequences.

## Key Points

Systems Theory Approach: STPA views systems as a set of interacting components rather than focusing only on individual failures. This holistic view helps uncover systemic risks that could arise from component interactions.

Hazard Identification: Instead of looking for specific component failures, STPA identifies unsafe control actions that can lead to hazardous situations. It focuses on what the system needs to prevent or control in order to avoid accidents.

Focus on Unsafe Control Actions: The key analysis in STPA is to identify unsafe control actions. These are actions taken by system components (including humans) that could lead to unsafe states, even if the individual components are functioning as intended.

Systemic Safety: STPA goes beyond the traditional methods of safety analysis (like FMEA or fault tree analysis) by identifying risks in system-level processes rather than just component failures.

Safety Constraints: Through the analysis, STPA helps define safety constraints—rules and guidelines that ensure the system behaves safely under all conditions.

## In Autonomous Robotic Applicaitons

STPA in Autonomous Robotics:

In the context of autonomous robotics, STPA can be used to analyze the interactions between different subsystems (e.g., perception, planning, control, and actuation) and identify safety-critical situations that could arise from the robot's operation, such as:

    Incorrect control inputs causing collisions or unintended behavior.

    Sensor failures leading to unsafe navigation decisions.

    Faulty planning decisions that lead to the robot executing dangerous actions.

STPA's approach to safety and hazard analysis is particularly useful in autonomous systems where traditional failure-based safety analysis techniques may miss complex interactions that can lead to hazards.

### STPA Steps

    Define System Boundaries: Identify the components and interactions within the system.

    Identify Unsafe Control Actions: Determine which control actions could lead to unsafe system behavior.

    Determine Causes of Unsafe Actions: Identify the potential causes (e.g., sensor errors, miscommunication, or software bugs).

    Develop Safety Constraints: Establish rules to prevent unsafe behaviors or mitigate risks.

    Iterative Analysis: Continuously refine the safety analysis as new risks are identified and the system evolves.

By applying STPA, engineers can ensure that their autonomous robot functions safely and reliably in complex environments.

#### SLAM Autonomous Map Generation and Localisation 

Applying STPA to SLAM-based Autonomous Robotics

To understand how System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) can be applied to your SLAM-based autonomous robotics project, let's walk through a simplified example of how to use STPA to identify hazards and safety constraints for your system. We will consider various subsystems of the robot, such as perception (SLAM), decision-making (navigation/planning), and actuation (robot movement), and analyze the potential risks in these areas.
1. Define the System Boundaries

For a SLAM-based autonomous robot, the system includes several interacting components:

    Sensors: Cameras, LiDAR, IMU, GPS, etc.

    Perception System: SLAM algorithm (e.g., ORB-SLAM, vSLAM).

    Decision-Making System: Path planning, behavior trees, navigation stack (e.g., using ROS 2 Nav2).

    Control System: Actuators (e.g., wheels, motors) and motion control.

    Human Interaction: Remote operator or emergency stop system.

2. Identify Unsafe Control Actions

Unsafe control actions are those that could lead to hazards in the system. For a SLAM-based autonomous robot, here are a few potential unsafe actions:

    Perception Issues (SLAM):

        Unsafe control action: The robot mislocalizes itself due to poor quality of sensor data or drift in SLAM.

        Impact: The robot could collide with obstacles or navigate outside safe boundaries (e.g., a farm field with crops or other robots).

    Navigation Issues:

        Unsafe control action: The navigation planner decides on an unsafe path (e.g., close to obstacles or over uneven terrain).

        Impact: The robot could run into obstacles, causing damage to the robot, the environment, or even humans.

    Control System Issues:

        Unsafe control action: The robot accelerates or turns too quickly, possibly due to a control algorithm bug or sensor failure.

        Impact: The robot could lose balance, tip over, or collide with obstacles, resulting in failure to achieve the desired goal.

    Safety Issues:

        Unsafe control action: The emergency stop system fails to stop the robot in critical situations.

        Impact: The robot might continue to operate unsafely, even if a dangerous situation arises (e.g., nearby humans or unexpected obstacles).

3. Determine Causes of Unsafe Actions

Once you've identified the unsafe control actions, the next step is to find out the potential causes behind these actions. These causes might stem from sensor issues, software bugs, hardware failure, or human error. Here are some possible causes for the unsafe control actions listed:

    Perception Issues:

        Cause: Sensor malfunction (e.g., camera failure, LiDAR sensor drift, or GPS inaccuracies).

        Cause: Poor environmental conditions (e.g., low light affecting camera performance, fog reducing LiDAR accuracy).

        Cause: Algorithmic errors in SLAM, such as poor feature extraction or map drift.

    Navigation Issues:

        Cause: Incorrect or outdated map data used for path planning.

        Cause: Insufficient or poor-quality localization data (e.g., GPS drift, IMU errors).

        Cause: Path planning algorithm bugs leading to improper decision-making (e.g., selecting a path too close to an obstacle).

    Control System Issues:

        Cause: Incorrect motion control parameters (e.g., too fast acceleration or poor speed control).

        Cause: Actuator failures (e.g., motor malfunction, wheel slippage).

        Cause: Software bugs in the motion control system.

    Safety Issues:

        Cause: Malfunctioning or unresponsive emergency stop system.

        Cause: Human operator error, such as not triggering the emergency stop when needed.

        Cause: Lack of redundancy or fail-safe mechanisms in the emergency stop system.

4. Develop Safety Constraints

Now that we know the unsafe actions and their causes, the next step is to define safety constraints to prevent those unsafe actions from occurring. These constraints should guide the robot’s operation to ensure safety. Here are some safety constraints for your SLAM-based autonomous robot:

    Perception Constraints:

        Safety constraint: Ensure SLAM algorithm performs an integrity check for the map at regular intervals to avoid drift.

        Safety constraint: Include fallback or backup sensors in case primary sensors fail (e.g., using IMU and LiDAR together for better robustness).

        Safety constraint: Ensure proper calibration of cameras, LiDAR, and GPS for accurate localization in the environment.

    Navigation Constraints:

        Safety constraint: Use obstacle detection algorithms to prevent path planning from selecting routes that are too close to obstacles.

        Safety constraint: Implement a local replanning mechanism to avoid obstacles and dynamically adjust the robot’s path in real-time based on newly detected obstacles.

        Safety constraint: Ensure that the path planner considers robot speed, terrain type, and environmental factors when generating routes.

    Control System Constraints:

        Safety constraint: Limit robot speed and acceleration based on environmental conditions (e.g., slow down on uneven terrain).

        Safety constraint: Use PID control or adaptive control to ensure smooth motion and compensate for actuator or sensor imperfections.

        Safety constraint: Implement a fallback system for movement in case of actuator failures (e.g., the robot should stop or return to a safe position).

    Safety System Constraints:

        Safety constraint: Emergency stop system must be fail-safe and can be triggered manually or autonomously when a hazard is detected.

        Safety constraint: Implement redundancy in the emergency stop system (e.g., multiple independent triggers for stopping).

        Safety constraint: Regularly test the emergency stop mechanism through software diagnostics or manual testing.

5. Iterative Analysis

STPA is an iterative process, meaning you should continuously refine and update the analysis as your system evolves. For example:

    As new sensors or algorithms are added (e.g., adding a new LiDAR sensor), you should revisit your safety constraints to ensure they account for the new components and interactions.

    When deploying the robot in new environments, you may uncover previously unnoticed hazards that require additional safety constraints or modifications to existing ones.
