Graph Neural Networks generalize the concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks
and Transformers by following a neural message passing scheme (see Fig. 1), in which
the computation graph of the network is no longer fixed but instead part of the input.
This makes GNNs broadly applicable to a wide range of applications, even on highly
irregular input structures. In addition, it allows us to actually witness them as a new
paradigm on how to define neural networks. Despite recent successes with LLMs on
large-language corpuses, GNNs utilize their built-in structural inductive bias to derive
accurate predictions even on only sparsely available data with low computational budget.
